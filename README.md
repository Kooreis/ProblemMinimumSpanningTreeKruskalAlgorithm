# Question: How do you compute the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a console application that computes the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal's algorithm. The code first defines a class called UnionFind, which is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It has methods for adding new sets, merging sets, and finding a representative member of a set. The code then defines a function called kruskal that takes a list of nodes and edges as input. This function creates a new instance of the UnionFind class, sorts the edges in ascending order based on their weights, and then iterates over them. For each edge, the function checks if the two nodes of the edge are connected. If they are not, it connects them and adds the edge to the minimum spanning tree. If they are already connected, it skips the edge to avoid creating a cycle. The function finally returns the minimum spanning tree. The code then defines a list of nodes and edges and calls the kruskal function with these lists as input, printing the result to the console.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more structured and object-oriented than the JavaScript version. It uses classes and types to define the structure of the graph and its edges, which makes the code more readable and easier to understand. 

In the TypeScript version, the `Edge` and `Graph` classes are defined with properties and methods. The `Edge` class has properties for the source, destination, and weight of an edge. The `Graph` class has properties for the vertices and edges of the graph, and methods to add edges, find the parent of a vertex, union two vertices, and compute the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.

The TypeScript version also uses type annotations to ensure that the correct types of values are used in the program. For example, the `addEdge` method of the `Graph` class takes three parameters of type `number`, and the `kruskalMST` method returns an array of `Edge` objects.

The JavaScript version, on the other hand, uses a more procedural approach. It defines a `UnionFind` class to represent the disjoint-set data structure used in Kruskal's algorithm, and a `kruskal` function to compute the minimum spanning tree. The `kruskal` function takes an array of nodes and an array of edges as parameters, and returns an array of edges that form the minimum spanning tree.

In terms of functionality, both versions solve the problem in a similar way. They both use Kruskal's algorithm to compute the minimum spanning tree of a graph, and they both use a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of the connected components of the graph. However, the TypeScript version is more structured and type-safe, which can make it easier to understand and maintain.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version, but there are some differences due to the language features and syntax.

1. Data Structures: In JavaScript, the UnionFind class uses an object (this.parent) to store the parent of each node. In C++, two vectors (parent and rank) are used instead. The parent vector stores the parent of each node, while the rank vector is used to optimize the union operation.

2. Class vs Functions: JavaScript uses a class (UnionFind) with methods for union, find, and connected operations. C++ uses standalone functions (make_set, find_set, union_sets) for these operations.

3. Operator Overloading: The C++ version uses operator overloading to compare edges based on their weights. This feature is not available in JavaScript, so a comparator function is passed to the sort method instead.

4. Input/Output: The JavaScript version hardcodes the nodes and edges, and logs the result to the console. The C++ version reads the number of nodes from the standard input, and prints the total cost and the edges in the minimum spanning tree to the standard output.

5. Memory Management: In C++, vectors parent and rank are resized before use. This is not necessary in JavaScript as arrays and objects can grow dynamically.

6. Looping: Both versions use a for loop to iterate over the edges. However, the C++ version uses a range-based for loop, which is a feature not available in JavaScript.

7. Type Safety: C++ is a statically typed language, so the types of all variables must be declared. JavaScript is dynamically typed, so variables can hold values of any type.
